# Kaufhaus

Kaufhaus is a React Native App (front end wise), I use this app to practice my RN skills and new concepts.

## What is Kaufhaus about?

Kaufhaus objective is to be helpful while you shop for groceries.

You may sometimes have a specific budget, you'd like to be able to scan a QR code or Bar code with your cellphone camara and add it to you Kaufhaus shopping list, that way you are able to see the price of the product with the help of some SuperMarket APIs, such as Walmarts, Costcos, etc.

## Why is it useful

The useful bit for the **user** is to know exactly how much they will pay for their cart, if anything has a discount, etc.

The useful bit for me is **data**, I'm also working experimentally in data science. The user will sometime benefit from data of their purchases, for example, how much they paid for the exact same product in any other super market. How products are increasing prices and what's the best supermarket to go grosery shopping to!

## Technologies used:

- React native in the front end.
- Firebase for Auth and Database.
- Python with tensorflow, numpy and pandas for data science and ML.
- Google analytics for analytics.
